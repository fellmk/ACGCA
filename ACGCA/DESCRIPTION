Description: The Allometrically Constrained Growth and Carbon Allocation (ACGCA) model is an individually based model of tree growth and mortality originally developed by Ogle and Pacala (2009). As the name implies the ACGCA model makes use of functional traits and allometries between tissue types (i.e. leaves, roots, and stems) to determine carbon allocation in a tree.
