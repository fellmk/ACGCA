    brrest height or 0.4m (40 cm) (m)}
 }}

\item{r0}{The starting radius. Defaults to 0.05m.}

\item{parmax}{The maximum yearly iradiance, defaults to 2060
(MJ m^-2 year^-1) and can be either a vector of length steps*years+1 or a
single value.}

\item{years}{The number of years to run the simulation, defaults to 50
years.}

\item{steps}{The number of time steps per year, defaults to 16.}

\item{breast.height}{The height DBH is taken at, defaults to 1.37 m.}

\item{Forparms}{A list of forest parameters: Forestparms = list(kF = 0.6,
HFmax=40, LAIFmax=6.0, infF=3.4, slopeF=-5.5). The values listed are
defaults based on Ogle and Pacala (2009). kF is the forest canopy light
extinction coefficient, HFmax is the maximum forest canopy height, LAIFmax
is the forest canopy maximum leaf area index, intF and slopeF are the
intercept and slope terms respectively when modeling the "unnormalized"
LAI profile (Ogle and Pacala 2009 supplement) on the logit scale.}

\item{gapvars}{A list of gap simulation parameters: gapvars = list(gt = 50,
ct=10, tbg=200). The default values are arbitrary and should be updated
outside of testing. The elements of the list refer to gap time (gt, years),
closure time (ct, years), and time between gaps (tbg, years). In the default
case a gap will be open for 50 years, the canopy will cose for 10 years,
followed by 140 years of closed canopy conditions after which a new gap will
form at year 201.}

\item{tolerance}{The tolerance for the algorithm that balances excess labile
carbon in the difference equations describing carbon dynamics of a healthy
tree (Ogle and Pacala, 2009). The default is 0.00001 and likely does not
need to be changed.}

\item{gapsim}{If TRUE gap simulations will run if FALSE (default) gap
simulations don't run.}

\item{fulloutput}{Is the full output desired if so set this to TRUE. The
default is FALSE.}
